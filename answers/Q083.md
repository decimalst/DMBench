### 83 &nbsp;Repairing a *Simulacrum* with *Wish*

RAW: *Simulacrum* “can’t regain hit points and is not restored to its original hit point maximum.” However, *Wish* can replicate **any spell** or accomplish greater miracles at DM’s discretion. A DM could allow *Wish* to overwrite that limitation, but by strict RAW it is the **only** spell that might. Solution should cite the “can’t regain hit points” clause and note that *Wish* is a DM fiat answer.
