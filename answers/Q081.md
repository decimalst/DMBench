### 81â€¯&nbsp;Mounted Combatant Advantage Clause

When an attacker targets the rider **instead** of the mount, the rider (with the feat) gains **advantage** on Dex saves **and** attack rolls against it have **disadvantage**. Example: An orc throws a javelin at the halfling rider; javelin attack is at disadvantage. If the attacker has both advantage and disadvantage from different sources, they cancel to normal.
