### 90 &nbsp;Counter‑Counterspell Chain

*Counterspell* is a reaction to a spell **being cast**. Each spell in the chain appears **while previous reaction is resolving**; order resolves last‑in first‑out. Initiative does not change, but each caster expends a reaction and spell slot. Chain ends when a caster lacks reaction or elects not to counter.
