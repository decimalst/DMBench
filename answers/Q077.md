### 77 &nbsp;*Haste* Ends Mid‑Turn

When *Haste* ends, the creature:

1. **Immediately** loses the extra action granted that turn (already used in the example).
2. Becomes **lethargic**: it cannot move or take actions until the end of its next turn and its speed is halved (PHB p. 250).

Thus, after concentration drops, the rogue cannot use its bonus action this turn and is lethargic on its following turn.
