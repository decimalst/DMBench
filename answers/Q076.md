### 76 &nbsp;Counterspell vs. *Subtle Spell*

A caster normally identifies a spell when they **see** its casting (PHB p. 228). *Subtle Spell* removes verbal + somatic components, leaving no visible sign. RAW, the **DM may rule** that the casting is imperceptible; if so, *Counterspell* cannot be readied and therefore fails. Some tables allow an **Arcana check** to intuit the casting. Award full credit for either ruling **if** the answer cites the component‑based identification rule and reaches a consistent conclusion.
