### 86 &nbsp;Wild Shape, KO, and Instant Healing

If the druid drops to 0 HP in beast form and is then healed (e.g., by *Healing Word*) **before** their next turn, they revert to humanoid form at the 0 HP point; healing then applies to humanoid HP. Wild Shape is **ended** because hitting 0 HP causes reversion.
