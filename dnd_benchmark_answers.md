# D&D 5e Benchmark **Scenario Solutions** (Q76–Q100)

Each solution describes the RAW outcome and mentions common table interpretations where relevant. Use as a rubric (0 = incorrect, 1 = partially correct, 2 = fully correct).

---

### 76 &nbsp;Counterspell vs. *Subtle Spell*

A caster normally identifies a spell when they **see** its casting (PHB p. 228). *Subtle Spell* removes verbal + somatic components, leaving no visible sign. RAW, the **DM may rule** that the casting is imperceptible; if so, *Counterspell* cannot be readied and therefore fails. Some tables allow an **Arcana check** to intuit the casting. Award full credit for either ruling **if** the answer cites the component‑based identification rule and reaches a consistent conclusion.

---

### 77 &nbsp;*Haste* Ends Mid‑Turn

When *Haste* ends, the creature:

1. **Immediately** loses the extra action granted that turn (already used in the example).
2. Becomes **lethargic**: it cannot move or take actions until the end of its next turn and its speed is halved (PHB p. 250).

Thus, after concentration drops, the rogue cannot use its bonus action this turn and is lethargic on its following turn.

---

### 78 &nbsp;Concentration Check for 28 Damage

DC is the higher of **10 or half the damage**: 28 ÷ 2 = 14 ⇒ **DC 14** Constitution save.  
*Success*: *Polymorph* remains. *Failure*: spell ends, ally reverts to original form with its previous HP.

---

### 79 &nbsp;Throwing Alchemist’s Fire (Improvised Weapon)

* Attack: Dexterity‑based ranged attack, range **20/60 ft** (thrown improvised).  
* Proficiency: only if the character has proficiency with **improvised weapons** or **Alchemist’s supplies** as ruled by DMG.  
* Hit: target takes **1d4 fire**; at the start of each of its turns it takes **1d4** more until it or an adjacent creature uses an action to extinguish.

---

### 80 &nbsp;Sneak Attack with a Readied Shot

Sneak Attack is **once per turn** (not per round).  
* Reaction shot happens on **another creature’s turn** → qualifies for Sneak Attack.  
* Rogue’s own turn begins → may Sneak Attack again.  
Total: **two Sneak Attacks** in the round, both legal.

---

### 81 &nbsp;Mounted Combatant Advantage Clause

When an attacker targets the rider **instead** of the mount, the rider (with the feat) gains **advantage** on Dex saves **and** attack rolls against it have **disadvantage**. Example: An orc throws a javelin at the halfling rider; javelin attack is at disadvantage. If the attacker has both advantage and disadvantage from different sources, they cancel to normal.

---

### 82 &nbsp;Devil’s Sight & Magical Darkness

*Devil’s Sight* allows the creature to **see normally** in both normal and magical darkness out to 120 ft. Therefore, it **is not blinded**, and can target creatures inside the *Darkness* spell normally, while those creatures cannot see it.

---

### 83 &nbsp;Repairing a *Simulacrum* with *Wish*

RAW: *Simulacrum* “can’t regain hit points and is not restored to its original hit point maximum.” However, *Wish* can replicate **any spell** or accomplish greater miracles at DM’s discretion. A DM could allow *Wish* to overwrite that limitation, but by strict RAW it is the **only** spell that might. Solution should cite the “can’t regain hit points” clause and note that *Wish* is a DM fiat answer.

---

### 84 &nbsp;Grappling a Prone Creature

Action: **1 attack** using the Attack action for the grapple attempt (PHB p. 195).  
A prone creature’s speed is already 0 if grappled; grappler’s speed is **halved** when dragging it unless the grappler is one size larger.

---

### 85 &nbsp;Storing *Goodberry* in a Bag of Holding

RAW no conflict. *Goodberries* remain potent for **24 hours** regardless of storage. Bag of Holding’s timelessness does **not** extend berry duration (Sage Advice). After 24 h they wither.

---

### 86 &nbsp;Wild Shape, KO, and Instant Healing

If the druid drops to 0 HP in beast form and is then healed (e.g., by *Healing Word*) **before** their next turn, they revert to humanoid form at the 0 HP point; healing then applies to humanoid HP. Wild Shape is **ended** because hitting 0 HP causes reversion.

---

### 87 &nbsp;Sentinel vs. Mobile

Sentinel trigger: target provokes OA by moving. Mobile: OA against you are made with disadvantage and **on hit OA damage cannot reduce your speed**. Sentinel sets speed to 0 on **hit**. If the OA *hits*, Sentinel overrides Mobile and speed becomes 0 this turn.

---

### 88 &nbsp;*Teleportation Circle* inside *Tiny Hut*

Allowed. *Tiny Hut* blocks spells that target interior **from outside**; spells cast **inside** are unhindered. Circle can be drawn on the floor; when spell ends, hut remains.

---

### 89 &nbsp;*Revivify* After *Disintegrate*

*Disintegrate* reduces target to **ash**; only *True Resurrection* or *Wish* can restore. *Revivify* requires a “body”; no body remains ⇒ spell fails.

---

### 90 &nbsp;Counter‑Counterspell Chain

*Counterspell* is a reaction to a spell **being cast**. Each spell in the chain appears **while previous reaction is resolving**; order resolves last‑in first‑out. Initiative does not change, but each caster expends a reaction and spell slot. Chain ends when a caster lacks reaction or elects not to counter.

---

### 91 &nbsp;*Animate Dead* Control Limit

Control limit = **3 × spell level** undead. Casting again reasserts control over previously created undead **and** any new ones up to the limit; higher‑level slot increases limit for **that** casting only. Totals are not additive across castings.

---

### 92 &nbsp;Interrupted Long Rest

Two combats of 1 h each interrupt the 8‑h rest. Characters may still gain a long rest **if** the interruption is ≤ 1 h of strenuous activity **total** (XGE). Two separate hours = 2 h ⇒ rest **fails**; need to restart.

---

### 93 &nbsp;Hiding without Cover

RAW: need **obscurement** or **cover** to hide. Without it, stealth check cannot make you unseen. RAI some DMs allow distractions or distance. Answer must cite PHB p. 177 requirement.

---

### 94 &nbsp;Bladesinger Extra Attack + Cantrip

At 6th‑level, Bladesinger can replace one attack with a cantrip: e.g., take Attack action → first attack with rapier, second “attack” slot replaced by casting *Booming Blade* cantrip.

---

### 95 &nbsp;Silvered vs. Magical Resistance

Devils are resistant to **non‑magical** weapons that are not **silvered**. A silvered +0 longsword counts as non‑magical but overcome resistance because stat block specifies resistance to non‑magical **that aren’t silvered**. Thus damage is normal.

---

### 96 &nbsp;Potion Miscibility Table

Drinking a second potion before first ends → DMG table: roll d100; outcomes range from both potions working to explosion. Must roll once per pair. Answer should note 01–25 both work, etc.

---

### 97 &nbsp;Swimming in Heavy Armor

RAW: Disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim (PHB p. 183). Move speed halved unless you have a swim speed; no other penalty. Plate armor imposes check disadvantage, not inability.

---

### 98 &nbsp;Dropping Prone vs. *Lightning Bolt*

Dropping prone costs **no action**; movement can be used to drop prone. Being prone still leaves creature’s body in line‐area; provides **no benefit** vs. *Lightning Bolt*. Creature must use movement to drop and half movement to stand.

---

### 99 &nbsp;*Heat Metal* on Adamantine Armor

*Heat Metal* deals 2d8 fire the moment you cast and as bonus action each subsequent round. Adamantine’s crit immunity irrelevant; damage still applies and wearer has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until armor removed.

---

### 100 &nbsp;Turn Undead & Legendary Resistance

Undead that fail Wis save become turned/destroyed. A creature with **Legendary Resistance** may choose to succeed instead, negating the effect. If it has used all charges, it can be turned normally.
